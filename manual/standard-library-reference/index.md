## Getting Around

`exit([code])` — Quit (or control-D at the prompt). The default exit code is zero, indicating that the processes completed successfully.

`whos()` — Print information about global user-defined variables.

`edit("file"[, line])` — Edit a file optionally providing a line number to edit at. Returns to the julia prompt when you quit the editor. If the file name ends in ".jl" it is reloaded when the editor closes the file.

`edit(function[, types])` — Edit the definition of a function, optionally specifying a tuple of types to indicate which method to edit. When the editor exits, the source file containing the definition is reloaded.

`load("file")` — Evaluate the contents of a source file

## All Objects

`is(x, y)` — Determine whether `x` and `y` refer to the same object in memory.

`isa(x, type)` — Determine whether `x` is of the given type.

`isequal(x, y)` — True if and only if `x` and `y` have the same contents.
Loosely speaking, this means `x` and `y` would look the same when printed.

`isless(x, y)` — Test whether `x` is less than `y`. Provides a total order consistent with `isequal`. Values that are normally unordered, such as `NaN`, are ordered in an arbitrary but consistent fashion. This is the default comparison used by `sort`. Non-numeric types that can be ordered should implement this function.

`typeof(x)` — Get the concrete type of `x`.

`tuple(xs...)` — Construct a tuple of the given objects.

`ntuple(n, f::Function)` — Create a tuple of length `n`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element.

`uid(x)` — Get a unique integer id for `x`. `uid(x)==uid(y)` if and only if `is(x,y)`.

`hash(x)` — Compute an integer hash code such that `isequal(x,y)` implies `hash(x)==hash(y)`.

`finalizer(x, function)` — Register a function to be called on `x` when there are no program-accessible references to `x`. The behavior of this function is unpredictable if `x` is of a bits type.

`copy(x)` — Create a deep copy of `x`:
i.e. `copy` is called recursively on all constituent parts of `x`.
If a user-defined type should be recursively copied, a `copy` method should be defined for it which implements deep copying of an instance.

`convert(type, x)` — Try to convert `x` to the given type.

`promote(xs...)` — Convert all arguments to their common promotion type (if any), and return them all (as a tuple).

## Types

`subtype(type1, type2)` — True if and only if all values of `type1` are also of `type2`. Can also be written using the `<:` infix operator as `type1 <: type2`.

`typemin(type)` — The lowest value representable by the given (real) numeric type.

`typemax(type)` — The highest value representable by the given (real) numeric type.

`realmin(type)` — The smallest in absolute value non-denormal value representable by the given floating-point type

`realmax(type)` — The highest finite value representable by the given floating-point type

`sizeof(type)` — Size, in bytes, of the canonical binary representation of the given type, if any.

`eps([type])` — The distance between 1.0 and the next largest representable floating-point value of `type`. The only types that are sensible arguments are `Float32` and `Float64`. If `type` is omitted, then `eps(Float64)` is returned.

`eps(x)` — The distance between `x` and the next largest representable floating-point value of the same type as `x`.

`promote_type(type1, type2)` — Determine a type big enough to hold values of each argument type without loss, whenever possible. In some cases, where no type exists which to which both types can be promoted losslessly, some loss is tolerated; for example, `promote_type(Int64,Float64)` returns `Float64` even though strictly, not all `Int64` values can be represented exactly as `Float64` values.

## Generic Functions

`method_exists(f, tuple)` — Determine whether the given generic function has a method matching the given tuple of argument types.

`applicable(f, args...)` — Determine whether the given generic function has a method applicable to the given arguments.

`invoke(f, (types...), args...)` — Invoke a method for the given generic function matching the specified types (as a tuple), on the specified arguments. The arguments must be compatible with the specified types. This allows invoking a method other than the most specific matching method, which is useful when the behavior of a more general definition is explicitly needed (often as part of the implementation of a more specific method of the same function).

## Iteration

Sequential iteration is implemented by the methods `start`, `done`, and `next`.
The general `for` loop:

    for i = I
      # body
    end

is translated to:

    state = start(I)
    while !done(I, state)
      (i, state) = next(I, state)
      # body
    end

The `state` object may be anything, and should be chosen appropriately for each iterable type.

`start(iter)` — Get initial iteration state for an iterable object

`done(iter, state)` — Test whether we are done iterating

`(item, state) = next(iter, state)` — For a given iterable object and iteration state, return the current item and the next iteration state

## Signal Processing

FFT functions in Julia are largely implemented by calling functions from [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org)

`fft(A, dim)` — One dimensional FFT if input is a `Vector`. For n-d cases, compute fft of vectors along dimension `dim`

`fft2` — 2d FFT

`fft3` — 3d FFT

`fftn` — N-d FFT

`ifft(A, dim)` — Inverse FFT. Same arguments as `fft`. Julia does not normalize the results of `ifft`.

`ifft2` — Inverse 2d FFT

`ifft3` — Inverse 3d FFT

`ifftn` — Inverse N-d FFT

`fftshift(x)` — Swap the first and second halves of each dimension of `x`.

`fftshift(x,dim)` — Swap the first and second halves of the given dimension of array `x`.

`ifftshift(x[, dim])` — Undoes the effect of `fftshift`.

`filt(b,a,x)` — Apply filter described by vectors `a` and `b` to vector `x`.

`deconv(b,a)` — Construct vector `c` such that `b = conv(a,c) + r`. Equivalent to polynomial division.

`conv(u,v)` — Convolution of two vectors. Uses FFT algorithm.

`xcorr(u,v)` — Compute the cross-correlation of two vectors.

## Parallel Computing

`addprocs_local(n)` — Add processes on the local machine. Can be used to take advantage of multiple cores.

`addprocs_ssh({"host1","host2",...})` — Add processes on remote machines via SSH. Requires julia to be installed in the same location on each node, or to be available via a shared file system.

`addprocs_sge(n)` — Add processes via the Sun/Oracle Grid Engine batch queue, using `qsub`.

`nprocs()` — Get the number of available processors

`myid()` — Get the id of the current processor

`remote_call(id, func, args...)` — Call a function asynchronously on the given arguments on the specified processor. Returns a `RemoteRef`.

`wait(RemoteRef)` — Wait for a value to become available for the specified remote reference.

`fetch(RemoteRef)` — Wait for and get the value of a remote reference.

`remote_call_wait(id, func, args...)` — Perform `wait(remote_call(...))` in one message.

`remote_call_fetch(id, func, args...)` — Perform `fetch(remote_call(...))` in one message.

`put(RemoteRef, value)` — Store a value to a remote reference. Implements "shared queue of length 1" semantics: if a value is already present, blocks until the value is removed with `take`.

`take(RemoteRef)` — Fetch the value of a remote reference, removing it so that the reference is empty again.

`RemoteRef()` — Make an uninitialized remote reference on the local machine.

`RemoteRef(n)` — Make an uninitialized remote reference on processor `n`.

## Distributed Arrays

`darray(init, type, dims[, distdim, procs, dist])` — Construct a distributed array. `init` is a function of three arguments that will run on each processor, and should return an `Array` holding the local data for the current processor. Its arguments are `(T,d,da)` where `T` is the element type, `d` is the dimensions of the needed local piece, and `da` is the new `DArray` being constructed (though, of course, it is not fully initialized). `type` is the element type. `dims` is the dimensions of the entire `DArray`. `distdim` is the dimension to distribute in. `procs` is a vector of processor ids to use. `dist` is a vector giving the first index of each contiguous distributed piece, such that the nth piece consists of indexes `dist[n]` through `dist[n+1]-1`. If you have a vector `v` of the sizes of the pieces, `dist` can be computed as `cumsum([1,v])`. Fortunately, all arguments after `dims` are optional.

`darray(f, A)` — Transform `DArray` `A` to another of the same type and distribution by applying function `f` to each block of `A`.

`dzeros([type, ]dims, ...)` — Construct a distrbuted array of zeros. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by `darray`.

`dones([type, ]dims, ...)` — Construct a distrbuted array of ones. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by `darray`.

`dfill(x, dims, ...)` — Construct a distrbuted array filled with value `x`. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by `darray`.

`drand(dims, ...)` — Construct a distrbuted uniform random array. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by `darray`.

`drandn(dims, ...)` — Construct a distrbuted normal random array. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by `darray`.

`dcell(dims, ...)` — Construct a distrbuted cell array. Trailing arguments are the same as those accepted by `darray`.

`distribute(a[, distdim])` — Convert a local array to distributed

`localize(d)` — Get the local piece of a distributed array

`changedist(d, distdim)` — Change the distributed dimension of a `DArray`

`myindexes(d)` — A tuple describing the indexes owned by the local processor

`owner(d, i)` — Get the id of the processor holding index `i` in the distributed dimension

`procs(d)` — Get the vector of processors storing pieces of `d`

`distdim(d)` — Get the distributed dimension of `d`

`getcwd()` — Get the current working directory.

`setcwd("dir")` — Set the current working directory. Returns the new current directory.

`getpid()` — Get julia's process ID.

`time()` — Get the time in seconds since the epoch, with fairly high resolution.

`tic()` — Set a timer to be read by the next call to `toc` or `toq`. The macro call `@time expr` can also be used to time evaluation.

`toc()` — Print and return the time elapsed since the last `tic`

`toq()` — Return, but do not print, the time elapsed since the last `tic`

`EnvHash()` — A singleton of this type, `ENV`, provides a hash table interface to environment variables.

`dlopen(libfile)` — Load a shared library, returning an opaque handle

`dlsym(handle, sym)` — Look up a symbol from a shared library handle

## Errors

`error(message)` — Raise an error with the given message

`throw(e)` — Throw an object as an exception

`errno()` — Get the value of the C library's `errno`

`strerror(n)` — Convert a system call error code to a descriptive string

`assert(cond)` — Raise an error if `cond` is false. Also available as the macro `@assert expr`.

## Tasks

`Task(func)` — Create a `Task` (i.e. thread, or coroutine) to execute the given function. The task exits when this function returns.

`yieldto(task, args...)` — Switch to the given task. The first time a task is switched to, the task's function is called with `args`. On subsequent switches, `args` are returned from the task's last call to `yieldto`.

`current_task()` — Get the currently running Task.

`istaskdone(task)` — Tell whether a task has exited.

`consume(task)` — Receive the next value passed to `produce` by the specified task.

`produce(value)` — Send the given value to the last `consume` call, switching to the consumer task.

`make_scheduled(task)` — Register a task with the main event loop, so it will automatically run when possible.

`yield()` — For scheduled tasks, switch back to the scheduler to allow another scheduled task to run.

`tls(symbol)` — Look up the value of a symbol in the current task's task-local storage.

`tls(symbol, value)` — Assign a value to a symbol in the current task's task-local storage.
